# NovelFables

Welcome to the NovelFables GitHub repository!

NovelFables is a React application that I'm excited to start building. This app aims to provide a platform for reading and exploring a diverse collection of novels and fables, and visualizing your reading habits with tracking data. This repository serves as the starting point for the development of NovelFables, and it is currently under construction. 

## Features (Planned)

- Browse and search: Users can browse through a vast library of novels, as well as utilize a powerful search functionality to find specific titles or authors, leveraging Google Books API.
- Bookshelf: Users can user default shelves or create personal bookshelves, add books to their public or private shelves, and track their reading progress. 
- Reading analytics: Users will have access to reading analytics, including data such as reading speed, reading time, and progress tracking. These analytics will provide insights into users' reading habits and help them set reading goals or track their reading performance over time.
- Reading Graphics: Users will be able to export pretty graphics of their monthly and annual reading recaps. 
- User authentication and registration: Users will be able to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.

Please note that these features are planned and currently in development. The repository will be regularly updated as progress is made.
